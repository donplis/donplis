- 👋 Hi, I’m Daniel (@donplis)
- 👀 I’m a remediation engineer. I'm interested in low impact living, and minimalism.
- 🌱 I’m looking to get started in computer science, and I'm currently learning online via the OSSU, having started in 2021.
- 💞️ I see computer science as a versatile tool which will allow me to create and build.
